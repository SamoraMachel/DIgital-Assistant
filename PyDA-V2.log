		The biblical term "proselyte" is an anglicization of the Koine Greek term œÄœÅŒøœÉŒÆŒªœÖœÑŒøœÇ (proselytos), 
as used in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) for "stranger", i.e. a "newcomer to Israel"; a "sojourner in the land", 
and in the Greek New Testament for a first-century convert to Judaism, generally from Ancient Greek religion. It is a 
translation of the Biblical Hebrew phrase ◊í◊® ◊™◊ï◊©◊ë (ger toshav)."Proselyte" also has the more general meaning in English 
of a new convert to any particular religion or doctrine.

bereavement :
		Grief is the response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond 
or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, 
behavioral, social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement 
refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss.
The grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses 
throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. Loss can be categorized as either physical 
or abstract, the physical loss being related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through 
death, while other types of loss are abstract, and relate to aspects of a person's social interactions.

Anglo :
		The Anglo-Saxons were a cultural group who inhabited Great Britain from the 5th century. They comprised people from Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe, their descendants, and indigenous British groups who adopted many aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language. The Anglo-Saxons established the Kingdom of England, and the modern English language owes almost half of its words ñ including the most common words of everyday speech ñ to their language. 
Historically, the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066, after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest.
The early Anglo-Saxon period includes the creation of an English nation, with many of the aspects that survive today, including regional government of shires and hundreds. During this period, Christianity was established and there was a flowering of literature and language. Charters and law were also established. The term Anglo-Saxon is popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern Scotland between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century. In scholarly use, it is more commonly called Old English.The history of the Anglo-Saxons is the history of a cultural identity. It developed from divergent groups in association with the people's adoption of Christianity and was integral to the establishment of various kingdoms. Threatened by extended Danish invasions and military occupation of eastern England, this identity was re-established; it dominated until after the Norman Conquest. The visible Anglo-Saxon culture can be seen in the material culture of buildings, dress styles, illuminated texts and grave goods. Behind the symbolic nature of these cultural emblems, there are strong elements of tribal and lordship ties. The elite declared themselves as kings who developed burhs, and identified their roles and peoples in Biblical terms. Above all, as Helena Hamerow has observed, "local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production throughout the Anglo-Saxon period." The effects persist in the 21st century as, according to a study published in March 2015, the genetic makeup of British populations today shows divisions of the tribal political units of the early Anglo-Saxon period.Use of the term Anglo-Saxon assumes that the words Angles, Saxons or Anglo-Saxon have the same meaning in all the sources. This term began to be used only in the 8th century to distinguish "Germanic" groups in Britain from those on the continent (Old Saxony and 
from the Anglia region in Northern Germany). Catherine Hills summarised the views of many modern scholars in her observation that attitudes towards Anglo-Saxons, and hence the interpretation of their culture and history, have been "more contingent on contemporary political and religious theology as on any kind of evidence."

samora :
		Samara (Russian: –°–∞–º–∞ÃÅ—Ä–∞, IPA: [s…êÀàmar…ô]), known from 1935 to 1991 as Kuybyshev (–ö—É–π–±—ã—à–µ–≤; IPA: [Ààkujb…® Ç…®f]), is the largest city and administrative centre of Samara Oblast. The city is located at the confluence of the Volga and the Samara rivers, with a population of over 1.1 million residents, up to 3 million residents in the urban agglomeration. The city covers an area of 541.382 square kilometers (209.029 sq mi), and is the eighth-largest city in Russia, the third-most populous city on the Volga, as well as the Volga Federal District.
Formerly a closed city, Samara is now a large and important social, political, economic, industrial, and cultural centre in Russia and hosted the European Union‚ÄîRussia Summit in May 2007. It has a continental climate characterised by hot summers and cold winters. The life of Samara's citizens has always been intrinsically linked to the Volga River, which has not only served as the main commercial thoroughfare of Russia throughout several centuries, but also has great visual appeal. Samara's riverfront is considered one of the favourite recreation places both for local citizens and tourists. After the Soviet novelist Vasily Aksyonov visited Samara, he remarked: "I am not sure where in the West one can find such a long and beautiful embankment."
